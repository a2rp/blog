            <p>
                Movies show developers hammering keyboards at 2 a.m. while green code rains down the screen.
                Real life is calmer (and honestly, better): steady problem-solving, lots of reading, short bursts of
                focused building, and frequent small releases. Coffee helps—but it's not the main skill.

            <Styled.Analogy>
                <p>
                    <strong>Analogy:</strong> A dev team is like a <em>restaurant kitchen</em>.
                    Tickets (tasks) arrive, the team preps, plates, and sends dishes (features) out reliably.
                    The magic isn't one genius chef—it's clean stations, shared checklists, and tasting everything before it leaves.
                </p>

            <h2>08:45 — Inbox &amp; Triage (30 minutes)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alerts:</strong> Any production errors overnight? Check monitoring dashboards.</li>
                <li><strong>PR Reviews:</strong> Skim peers' code. Good reviews catch bugs early and spread knowledge.</li>
                <li><strong>Plan the day:</strong> Pick 1-2 “must ship” items. Everything else is optional.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>10:00 — Standup (10 minutes)</h2>
            <p>
                A quick sync with designers, PMs, and other devs: what shipped yesterday, what's next, and any blockers.
                The goal isn't status theater—it's <em>unblocking flow</em>.
            </p>

            <h2>10:15 — Deep Work Block (90-120 minutes)</h2>
            <p>
                Headphones on. This is where code happens, but writing code is the <em>last</em> step of thinking:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Clarify</strong> the user story. What should the user feel/see?</li>
                <li><strong>Sketch</strong> a solution (notes, tiny diagrams).</li>
                <li><strong>Spike</strong> a small prototype to test assumptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Implement</strong> the real thing with tests and small commits.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The best days are boring: no heroics, just steady progress and clean diffs.
            </p>

            <h2>12:30 — Reviews, Pairing &amp; Design Handoffs</h2>
            <p>
                Development isn't solo. We read more code than we write. We pair on tricky parts, discuss edge cases
                with QA, and confirm UX details with designers. Small feedback loops beat big reworks.
            </p>

            <h2>14:00 — Ship Safely (little and often)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Open PR</strong> with a clear description, screenshots, and how to test.</li>
                <li><strong>CI runs</strong> (tests, lint, build). Fix red checks before asking humans to review.</li>
                <li><strong>Merge behind a feature flag</strong> when possible. Roll out to 1% → 10% → 100%.</li>
                <li><strong>Smoke test</strong> on staging and watch metrics after deploy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>15:30 — Maintenance (the invisible work)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Refactoring:</strong> Pay off small bits of tech debt so future work stays fast.</li>
                <li><strong>Dependencies:</strong> Update libraries and security patches.</li>
                <li><strong>Docs:</strong> Add a README note or ADR (architecture decision record) so the team's brain isn't trapped in DM threads.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>16:30 — Support &amp; Users</h2>
            <p>
                We sit with support/ops periodically to see real user pain. These conversations shape better defaults,
                clearer error messages, and simpler workflows than any internal debate.
            </p>

            <h2>Common Myths vs Reality</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Myth:</strong> It's all about writing new code. <br /> <strong>Reality:</strong> It's more about <em>reading</em> code and making small, reversible changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Developers build what they want. <br /> <strong>Reality:</strong> We solve user problems within business constraints—speed, budget, compliance.</li>
                <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Deploys are rare and risky. <br /> <strong>Reality:</strong> Healthy teams deploy many times a day with guardrails.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tools You Don't See (But Make the Web Work)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Branches, pull requests, code review.</li>
                <li><strong>CI/CD:</strong> Automated testing and one-click deploys.</li>
                <li><strong>Observability:</strong> Logs, metrics, traces, and alerts to catch issues early.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Flags:</strong> Release safely without big bangs.</li>
                <li><strong>Design Systems:</strong> Reusable UI parts to keep products consistent and accessible.</li>
            </ul>

            <Styled.Analogy>
                <p>
                    <strong>Builder's Note:</strong> Senior developers optimize <em>feedback loops</em>:
                    shorter PRs, faster tests, clearer dashboards, and tighter design/dev sync. Speed is a systems property, not a personality trait.
                </p>
            </Styled.Analogy>

            <h2>How to Work Well with Developers (If You're Not One)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Describe the problem, not the solution.</strong> “Users can't find X” beats “Move this button 4px.”</li>
                <li><strong>Bring examples &amp; data.</strong> A screenshot + steps to reproduce saves hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Prefer small scope.</strong> Ship a thin slice, learn, iterate.</li>
                <li><strong>Agree on “done.”</strong> Define test steps and acceptance criteria up front.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>If You're Considering This Career</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with a tiny project you'll actually use. Ship it publicly.</li>
                <li>Learn your browser's devtools. It's your stethoscope.</li>
                <li>Practice reading code—pick an open-source repo and follow a bug fix.</li>
                <li>Write things down. Good notes beat perfect memory.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
                A developer's day is less “genius breakthrough” and more “repeatable craft.”
                We design small changes, get fast feedback, and keep the product healthy.
                It's not glamorous—but it's deeply satisfying to ship something real and watch
                people use it the same day.
