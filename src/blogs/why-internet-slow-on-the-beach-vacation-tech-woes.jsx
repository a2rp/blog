            <p>
                You get to the beach, open Maps, and… nothing loads. It's not just you. Vacation spots put
                unusual pressure on networks: thousands of phones hitting the same towers and hotel Wi-Fi at
                the same time, in blazing heat that makes devices throttle. As a developer (and traveler),
                here's a clear look at <em>why</em> it happens and the simple moves that actually help.
            </p>

            <Styled.Analogy>
                <p>
                    <strong>Analogy:</strong> Picture the network like a <em>set of roads to a tiny island</em>.
                    On a regular day, cars zip through. On a holiday weekend, the roads (airwaves), the bridge
                    (cell tower backhaul), and the parking lot (hotel router) all overflow—everyone slows down.
                </p>
            </Styled.Analogy>

            <h2>Why It's Slow (Plain English)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tower overload:</strong> One cell site serves a beach/market/festival. When
                    thousands stream and upload at once, congestion and scheduling delays spike.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Backhaul limits:</strong> Even if your phone has full bars, the tower's link to
                    the wider internet may be the bottleneck.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Radio physics:</strong> Higher-frequency 5G bands are fast but don't travel far or
                    through obstacles; you may fall back to slower bands in crowded/obstructed areas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hotel/airport Wi-Fi design:</strong> Few access points, wrong channels, cheap
                    repeaters, and captive portals = slow + flaky.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Heat &amp; battery savers:</strong> Direct sun warms your phone; to avoid damage,
                    the modem/CPU throttles → lower throughput.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Quick Fixes That Often Work</h2>

            <h3>Cellular Data</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Airplane mode reset (10s):</strong> Toggle on/off to re-attach to a less loaded cell.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Try 4G/LTE vs 5G:</strong> If 5G is weak/congested, LTE can be more stable. Check your
                    network settings and test—whichever is faster wins.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Move 10-30 meters:</strong> Step away from dense crowds, metal shade structures, or down in
                    pits; small shifts can improve line-of-sight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keep the phone cool:</strong> Shade it, close background nav/video apps, remove thick cases.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Roaming abroad?</strong> Manually pick a different partner network if your plan allows.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Wi-Fi (Hotels/Cafés)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prefer 5&nbsp;GHz (or 6&nbsp;GHz if available):</strong> If you see networks like <em>Hotel-5G</em>,
                    choose those over 2.4&nbsp;GHz. They're less crowded and faster at short range.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Get closer to an AP:</strong> Look for smoke-detector-like disks on ceilings/walls; sit nearby.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Finish the captive portal:</strong> Open a non-HTTPS site (e.g., <code>neverssl.com</code>) to trigger login.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Forget &amp; re-join:</strong> Clears a bad DHCP/portal session. Try another floor if possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>VPN?</strong> Use it for sensitive tasks on public Wi-Fi. For speed on trusted hotel Wi-Fi,
                    disabling the VPN <em>may</em> help—trade-off is privacy.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>App &amp; Phone Settings (Data-Saver Mode)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Download offline</strong> maps/playlists before heading out; pre-cache routes in the hotel at night.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lower quality</strong> for streaming calls/video temporarily (360/480p).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pause auto-uploads</strong> (photos, cloud drives) on mobile data; resume on hotel Wi-Fi.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Turn off background refresh</strong> for chat/social during the day; messages still arrive, less chatter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use Wi-Fi Calling</strong> when cell voice is choppy (if supported).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Troubleshooting Flow (Copy/Paste)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Speed test + bars check</strong> (don't trust bars alone).</li>
                <li><strong>Airplane toggle</strong> → retry.</li>
                <li><strong>Switch 5G⇄LTE</strong> → retry.</li>
                <li><strong>Move location</strong> (shade/high ground/near window).</li>
                <li><strong>Try Wi-Fi</strong> 5/6&nbsp;GHz near an AP → complete portal login.</li>
                <li><strong>Data saver on</strong>, reduce media quality, pause uploads.</li>
            </ol>

            <Styled.Analogy>
                <p>
                    <strong>Builder's Note:</strong> Designing apps for travelers? Go <em>offline-first</em>.
                    Cache critical screens, queue writes, show a clear “sync pending,” use adaptive bitrate,
                    and chunk uploads with resume + exponential backoff. A tiny “Last synced 2m ago” label
                    earns more trust than any spinner.
                </p>
            </Styled.Analogy>

            <h2>Edge Cases You Might Hit</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Captive portal + VPN loop:</strong> Disable VPN, complete login, then re-enable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Phone hot-spotting to a laptop:</strong> If others are nearby, set hotspot to 5&nbsp;GHz and add a password.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Group congestion:</strong> Stagger large downloads/uploads across the group; one person pulls maps, others share offline.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Emergency readiness:</strong> Save offline contacts and local emergency numbers; don't rely on cloud for access.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Printable Mini-Checklist</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>[ ] Offline maps/music downloaded last night</li>
                <li>[ ] Data saver on; auto-uploads paused on mobile</li>
                <li>[ ] Airplane toggle tried; 5G⇄LTE tested</li>
                <li>[ ] Prefer 5/6&nbsp;GHz Wi-Fi near an AP</li>
                <li>[ ] Phone kept cool; case off in direct sun</li>
                <li>[ ] Roaming partner switched (if abroad)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
                Beach days are hard days for networks. With a couple of toggles, some offline prep, and a cool phone,
                you'll get from “stuck” to “usable” fast—enough to load the map, send the photo, and then put the phone
                away again.
