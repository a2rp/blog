            <p>
                If the internet were a city, open source would be the roads, bridges, and power lines. It’s the quietly
                maintained infrastructure that everything else sits on—your apps, your favorite websites, even the tools
                companies use to build software. But “open source” isn’t just “free code.” It’s a way of working together.

            <Styled.Analogy>
                <p>
                    <strong>Analogy:</strong> Think of open source like a <em>community garden</em>. People plant seeds,
                    pull weeds, label plants, fix fences, and share the harvest. Some folks visit daily; others drop by
                    once a season. The garden grows because many hands care for it.

            <h2>What “Open Source” Really Means</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Source code is public.</strong> You can read it, learn from it, and suggest changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Licenses grant permissions.</strong> You can use, modify, and redistribute the code—within rules.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration happens in the open.</strong> Bugs, discussions, and fixes are visible to everyone.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Companies Bet on It</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Don’t reinvent the wheel—reuse proven libraries and frameworks.</li>
                <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Many eyes mean more bug reports, more edge cases, and faster fixes.</li>
                <li><strong>Talent &amp; Trust:</strong> Public work builds credibility and attracts contributors.</li>
                <li><strong>Standards:</strong> Shared building blocks lead to interoperable systems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Workflow (Behind the Scenes)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Issue is filed</strong> (bug, feature request, doc fix).</li>
                <li><strong>Discussion</strong> clarifies scope, edge cases, and approach.</li>
                <li><strong>Pull Request (PR)</strong> proposes a change—code, tests, docs.</li>
                <li><strong>Review</strong> by maintainers/community; CI runs tests and checks.</li>
                <li><strong>Merge &amp; Release</strong>—often with changelogs and version bumps.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Licenses: The 60-Second Guide</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MIT:</strong> Very permissive. Use it in commercial/closed-source apps; just keep the notice.</li>
                <li><strong>Apache-2.0:</strong> Permissive + patent protections. Good for businesses.</li>
                <li><strong>GPL:</strong> “Copyleft.” If you distribute a modified version, you must open source it too.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Rule of thumb: if you want maximum adoption, choose a permissive license (MIT/Apache-2.0). If you want
                improvements to flow back, consider GPL. Always include a <code>LICENSE</code> file.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Contribute (Even if You’re New)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Docs &amp; examples:</strong> Fix typos, clarify steps, add a quick-start snippet.</li>
                <li><strong>Repro cases:</strong> Create a minimal demo that proves a bug—huge help to maintainers.</li>
                <li><strong>Issue triage:</strong> Label duplicates, confirm bugs on latest version, suggest steps.</li>
                <li><strong>Tests:</strong> Add coverage for an edge case you hit.</li>
                <li><strong>Code:</strong> Start small—one file, one function, one fix.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>First PR Playbook (Copy/Paste This)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Read <code>README</code>, <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code>, and <code>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</code>.</li>
                <li>Comment on an issue: “I can take this”—ask for scope confirmation.</li>
                <li>Fork, create a branch: <code>fix/typo-README</code> or <code>feat/add-null-check</code>.</li>
                <li>Add tests (if applicable) and run the project locally.</li>
                <li>Open PR with: <em>what</em> changed, <em>why</em>, screenshots/logs, and <em>how to test</em>.</li>
                <li>Respond kindly to review feedback; keep commits small and focused.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Maintainers: The Unseen Heroes</h2>
            <p>
                Maintainers are the gardeners who water regularly: reviewing PRs, cutting releases, writing docs,
                answering questions, and saying “no” when it keeps the project healthy. Many do this after hours.
                Be patient; be specific; say thanks.
            </p>

            <Styled.Analogy>
                <p>
                    <strong>Builder’s Note:</strong> Running a project? Add a <em>“Good First Issue”</em> label, a one-line
                    PR template, and a <code>help-wanted</code> board. Clear on-ramps convert readers into contributors.
                </p>
            </Styled.Analogy>

            <h2>Funding &amp; Sustainability (Quick Tour)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sponsors/Grants:</strong> Individuals or companies fund maintainers.</li>
                <li><strong>Dual licensing:</strong> Open core + commercial add-ons or terms.</li>
                <li><strong>Company time:</strong> Employers sponsor contributions because they rely on the project.</li>
                <li><strong>Foundations:</strong> Neutral homes for governance, trademarks, and budgets.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Evaluate a Repo Before You Depend on It</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maintenance signals:</strong> Recent commits, open PR response time, tagged releases.</li>
                <li><strong>Bus factor:</strong> One maintainer or many? (More is safer.)</li>
                <li><strong>Docs &amp; tests:</strong> Clear usage examples and test coverage.</li>
                <li><strong>License:</strong> Permissive vs. copyleft—fits your use?</li>
                <li><strong>Community tone:</strong> Friendly, constructive issues and reviews.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Etiquette That Makes You Welcome</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reproduce first.</strong> Share versions, OS, steps, and minimal code.</li>
                <li><strong>Assume good intent.</strong> Written words can sound blunt; reviews aim to help.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep scope tight.</strong> One PR = one change. Big rewrites are hard to review.</li>
                <li><strong>Credit others.</strong> Mention prior art and link related issues.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Printable Mini-Checklist</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>[ ] Read README + CONTRIBUTING + LICENSE</li>
                <li>[ ] Pick a small issue; confirm scope</li>
                <li>[ ] Add tests or a repro case</li>
                <li>[ ] Open a focused PR with steps/screens</li>
                <li>[ ] Respond kindly; iterate fast</li>
                <li>[ ] Thank maintainers; consider sponsoring</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
                Open source is a public workshop where anyone can help improve the tools we all use. Whether you fix a
                typo, report a bug, or ship a feature, you’re part of that story. Start small, be kind, and leave the code
                a little better than you found it.
