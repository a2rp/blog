            <p>
                You're staring at <em>full Wi-Fi bars</em>… but Instagram won't refresh. Did the internet break?
                Not exactly. Wi-Fi and the Internet are two different layers. Understanding the difference saves
                hours of frustration—and sometimes a pointless call to your ISP.
            </p>

            <Styled.Analogy>
                <p>
                    <strong>Analogy:</strong> <em>Wi-Fi is your home's driveway.</em> The <em>Internet is the highway network.</em>
                    Your phone can connect perfectly to the <em>driveway</em> (router) while a crash on the <em>highway</em>
                    (ISP outage) still stops you from reaching your destination.
                </p>
            </Styled.Analogy>

            <h2>Quick Definitions (No Jargon)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wi-Fi:</strong> The local, wireless link between your devices and your router. Works even with no internet.</li>
                <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Everything outside your home network—your ISP's line + the wider web.</li>
                <li><strong>Router:</strong> The traffic cop inside your home; gives devices IP addresses and forwards packets.</li>
                <li><strong>Modem/ONT:</strong> The box that talks to your ISP over fiber/cable/DSL. (Sometimes combined with the router.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Usual Home Setup (What Connects to What)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Wall/ISP line →</strong> <em>Modem/ONT</em></li>
                <li><strong>Modem/ONT →</strong> <em>Router</em> (often via Ethernet)</li>
                <li><strong>Router →</strong> <em>Devices</em> (Wi-Fi or Ethernet). Mesh nodes extend the same network further.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                If your TV streams a downloaded file from your laptop via Wi-Fi while the internet is down, that's normal:
                local network good, highway closed.
            </p>

            <h2>Common Symptoms, Decoded</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full bars, pages don't load:</strong> Wi-Fi OK, Internet likely down or DNS issue.</li>
                <li><strong>Some rooms slow, others fine:</strong> Wi-Fi signal/placement problem, not ISP speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Video calls freeze at 9 p.m. daily:</strong> Congestion—either your Wi-Fi channel is noisy (apartments) or ISP peak-hour saturation.</li>
                <li><strong>Only one device struggles:</strong> Device issue (drivers, old OS, captive portal not accepted).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2.4 GHz vs 5 GHz vs 6 GHz (Which One Should You Use?)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2.4 GHz:</strong> Longer range, penetrates walls better, but crowded and slower.</li>
                <li><strong>5 GHz:</strong> Faster, less interference, shorter range. Best default for most rooms near the router.</li>
                <li><strong>6 GHz (Wi-Fi 6E/7):</strong> Very fast, very clean, shortest range; shines for close, high-throughput tasks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If your router supports band steering (one SSID for all bands), keep it on. Otherwise, pick 5 GHz for speed,
                2.4 GHz for far corners or smart devices that only speak 2.4.
            </p>

            <h2>Speed vs Latency (Why Video Calls Break Before Downloads)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bandwidth (Mbps):</strong> “How wide is the pipe?” Good for downloads/streams.</li>
                <li><strong>Latency (ms):</strong> “How long does a ping take?” Critical for calls/gaming.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You can have 300&nbsp;Mbps and still suffer laggy calls if latency/jitter is high. Fixing Wi-Fi placement and interference often helps more than buying “faster internet.”
            </p>

            <h2>Router Placement (The 5-Minute Makeover)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Place it <strong>high and central</strong>—not in a metal cabinet or behind the TV.</li>
                <li>Avoid placing it next to <strong>microwaves, cordless phones,</strong> or thick concrete walls.</li>
                <li>Angle antennas: some vertical, some horizontal. Small changes help.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Extenders vs Mesh (Don't Create Franken-Wi-Fi)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Range extenders/repeaters:</strong> Cheap but halve throughput; often create a second network.</li>
                <li><strong>Mesh systems:</strong> Multiple nodes act as one network; better roaming and consistency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you have more than a 2-room apartment or multiple floors, a <strong>mesh</strong> kit is usually worth it.
                Wire the backhaul with Ethernet if you can for best results.
            </p>

            <h2>DNS: The “Phonebook” That Often Gets Blamed</h2>
            <p>
                If some sites work and others don't, try switching DNS on your router or device to a well-known resolver.
                It won't fix bad Wi-Fi, but it solves many “site won't load” mysteries.
            </p>

            <h2>5-Step Troubleshooting Flow (Copy/Paste)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Check local vs internet:</strong> Can you access the router admin page (e.g., <code>192.168.1.1</code>)? If yes, Wi-Fi is fine—suspect ISP/DNS.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed test near router:</strong> Stand beside it; compare Wi-Fi vs Ethernet if possible. If Ethernet is fast and Wi-Fi is slow → Wi-Fi issue.</li>
                <li><strong>Band hop:</strong> Try the 5&nbsp;GHz SSID; then try 2.4 for distant rooms.</li>
                <li><strong>Power cycle in order:</strong> Modem/ONT off 30s → on; router off 10s → on; then devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Change channel / width:</strong> In crowded apartments, set 2.4&nbsp;GHz to channels 1/6/11; 5&nbsp;GHz to non-DFS channels with 80&nbsp;MHz width (or 40 if interference).</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Security Basics You Should Turn On</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>WPA2/WPA3-Personal</strong> (avoid WEP/WPA). Use a strong passphrase.</li>
                <li><strong>Change default admin password</strong> of the router. Disable remote admin unless you need it.</li>
                <li><strong>Guest network</strong> for visitors and IoT gadgets. Keep your main network clean.</li>
                <li><strong>Firmware updates</strong> quarterly—patches fix bugs, stability, and security holes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When to Call the ISP (It's Not You, It's Them)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Loss of sync: modem “internet”/“LOS” light blinking red/amber consistently.</li>
                <li>Speed via <strong>Ethernet</strong> near the modem is far below your plan at multiple times of day.</li>
                <li>Frequent upstream errors: uploads stall, calls drop even on Ethernet.</li>
                <li>Neighborhood outage reports or scheduled maintenance notices.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Pro tip: Run two or three speed tests at <em>morning, evening, late night</em> and note results.
                ISPs take you more seriously with a mini log.
            </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Builder's Note:</strong> If you build apps, assume users are on flaky Wi-Fi.
                    Design <em>offline-first</em> flows, queue writes, retry with exponential backoff, and show
                    a clear “Last synced at 7:42 PM” rather than an eternal spinner.

            <h2>Apartment Survival Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Rename SSIDs to something simple; avoid identical names as neighbors.</li>
                <li>Prefer <strong>5/6&nbsp;GHz</strong> for work devices; park IoT on 2.4.</li>
                <li>Schedule heavy downloads/backups for late night.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Printable Mini-Checklist</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>[ ] Router high & central; not in a cabinet</li>
                <li>[ ] Use 5&nbsp;GHz (or 6&nbsp;GHz) for speed, 2.4 for reach</li>
                <li>[ ] Change router admin password; enable WPA2/WPA3</li>
                <li>[ ] Guest network for visitors/IoT</li>
                <li>[ ] Try channel 1/6/11 on 2.4&nbsp;GHz; non-DFS on 5&nbsp;GHz</li>
                <li>[ ] Speed test on Ethernet near modem to isolate ISP vs Wi-Fi</li>
                <li>[ ] Power-cycle modem → router → devices in that order</li>
                <li>[ ] Firmware up to date; consider mesh for bigger homes</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
                Wi-Fi is your local hop; the Internet is the world beyond. Treat them separately when things break:
                fix the <em>driveway</em> (placement, channels, security) and only then blame the <em>highway</em>.
                With a few smart tweaks, your bars will mean what you expect—fast, reliable, and boring (the good kind).
