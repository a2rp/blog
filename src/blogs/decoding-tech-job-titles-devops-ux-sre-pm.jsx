                “We’re hiring a Senior Staff Platform Engineer (DevEx) to partner with SRE, PM, and UX.” If that sentence
                made your eye twitch, you’re not alone. Titles vary by company size and culture, and many overlap. Here’s
                a friendly, non-jargony map so you can read job posts without needing a translator.

                <p>
                    <strong>Analogy:</strong> Building software is like making a film. You’ve got writers (PM), directors
                    (Tech Leads), actors (Engineers), set designers (UX/UI), editors (QA), and operations (SRE/DevOps)
                    making sure the movie actually reaches theaters. Same product, many crafts.

            <h2>The Quick Decoder Ring</h2>

            <h3>Frontend Engineer</h3>
            <p>
                Ships the parts you see and touch: UI, accessibility, performance in the browser, design systems. Works
                closely with designers and cares about pixels and interactions.
            </p>

            <h3>Backend Engineer</h3>
            <p>
                Builds APIs, databases, background jobs, auth, and business logic. Cares about data models, reliability,
                security, and speed on the server side.
            </p>

            <h3>Full-Stack Engineer</h3>
            <p>
                Comfortable across both layers; often thrives in small teams. Not “master of everything,” but good at
                taking thin features end-to-end.
            </p>

            <h3>DevOps / Platform Engineer</h3>
            <p>
                <em>DevOps</em> is a practice; <em>Platform</em> is a team that builds the internal tools, CI/CD, cloud
                infra, and developer experience (DevEx) so product teams ship faster and safer.
            </p>

            <h3>SRE (Site Reliability Engineer)</h3>
            <p>
                Reliability specialists. Measure and improve uptime, latency, on-call, incident response, and capacity.
                Think SLIs/SLOs, alerts, and runbooks.
            </p>

            <h3>QA / Test / Quality Engineer</h3>
            <p>
                Designs test strategies (manual + automated), catches regressions, and bakes quality into pipelines.
                In modern teams, quality is everyone’s job—but QA leads the craft.
            </p>

            <h3>UX Designer vs. UI Designer vs. Product Designer</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>UX</strong>: flows, user research, information architecture.</li>
                <li><strong>UI</strong>: visual design, components, spacing, states.</li>
                <li><strong>Product Designer</strong>: often does both UX + UI, partners tightly with PM and devs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Product Manager (PM) vs. Project vs. Program vs. TPM</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Product Manager</strong>: defines <em>what</em> to build and <em>why</em> (problems, bets, outcomes).</li>
                <li><strong>Project Manager</strong>: schedules and delivery tracking for a defined scope.</li>
                <li><strong>Program Manager</strong>: coordinates multiple projects across teams.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Program Manager (TPM)</strong>: program manager with deep technical context.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Roles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Engineer</strong>: pipelines, warehouses, ETL/ELT, data quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics Engineer</strong>: transforms raw data into analyst-friendly models (SQL, dbt).</li>
                <li><strong>Data Analyst</strong>: dashboards, insights, experiments, decision support.</li>
                <li><strong>ML Engineer</strong>: productionizes models; features, serving, monitoring.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Scientist</strong>: experimentation, modeling, statistical inference.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Security Engineer</h3>
            <p>
                Threat modeling, code reviews for vulns, secrets management, incident response, compliance guardrails.
            </p>

            <h3>Solutions Architect / Sales Engineer / DevRel</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solutions Architect</strong>: designs customer implementations; pre-sales + post-sales.</li>
                <li><strong>Sales Engineer</strong>: demos, prototypes, removes technical blockers in sales cycles.</li>
                <li><strong>Developer Relations (DevRel)</strong>: docs, samples, talks, community for developer products.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technical Writer</h3>
            <p>
                Turns complex systems into clear docs, guides, and tutorials. Underrated force multiplier.
            </p>

            <h2>Levels & Ladders (Why “Senior” Means Different Things)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IC vs Manager:</strong> ICs grow in scope/impact without direct reports; managers grow people/teams.</li>
                <li><strong>Titles like Staff/Principal</strong> usually mean large cross-team influence, not just harder tickets.</li>
                <li><strong>Numbers (L3–L7)</strong> vary by company; read responsibilities, not the digit.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Titles Differ Across Companies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stage:</strong> Startups blur roles; enterprises specialize.</li>
                <li><strong>Product:</strong> Infra companies over-index on SRE/Platform; consumer apps on UX/Frontend.</li>
                <li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Some call it DevOps; others SRE; others Platform—similar overlap.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Read a Job Description (Fast)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Daily work first:</strong> “You’ll spend your time…” is more truthful than title.</li>
                <li><strong>Inputs/outputs:</strong> What problems you’ll own and how success is measured.</li>
                <li><strong>Tooling vs fundamentals:</strong> Tools can be learned; look for principles (testing, observability, UX thinking).</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration map:</strong> Which teams you partner with tells you the real scope.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Picking a Path (Questions to Ask Yourself)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Do you like pixels or packets?</strong> (Frontend vs Backend/Infra)</li>
                <li><strong>Do you enjoy stability puzzles?</strong> (SRE/Platform) or <strong>user empathy puzzles?</strong> (UX/Frontend/PM)</li>
                <li><strong>Do you prefer experiments and stats?</strong> (Data/ML) or <strong>systems & APIs?</strong> (Backend)</li>
                <li><strong>Do you like guiding more than coding?</strong> (PM/TPM/Manager) or <strong>deep IC craft?</strong> (Staff/Principal)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Red Flags & Green Flags</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Green:</strong> Clear responsibilities, mentorship, realistic on-call, documented processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Red:</strong> Vague goals, “wear every hat forever,” constant fire-drills, no code review or tests.</li>
            </ul>

            <Styled.Analogy>
                <p>
                    <strong>Builder’s Note:</strong> Titles are labels, not destinies. Skills compound: a Frontend dev who
                    learns a bit of SRE ships faster; a PM who understands a11y makes better choices. Follow problems you
                    care about; let titles catch up.
                </p>
            </Styled.Analogy>

            <h2>Printable Mini-Checklist</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>[ ] What will I do daily? (top 3 tasks)</li>
                <li>[ ] Who are my closest partners? (teams & roles)</li>
                <li>[ ] How is success measured? (metrics/outcomes)</li>
                <li>[ ] What skills will I grow here in 12 months?</li>
                <li>[ ] Is the on-call/process healthy and humane?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
                Tech titles are shorthand for bundles of responsibilities. Read past the label, focus on the problems you’ll
                solve, and pick the craft that makes you curious to show up tomorrow. That’s the real fit.
