# Ashish’s Tech Blog

I used to blog on Blogger back in the day, and I'm writing **weekly again since January 2025**.

-   **Live site:** <a href="https://a2rp.github.io/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://a2rp.github.io/blog/</a>
-   **Older archives (Blogger):** <a href="https://passion4profession.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">passion4profession.blogspot.com</a>
-   **Portfolio:** <a href="https://www.ashishranjan.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ashishranjan.net</a>

## What this is

-   A **file-based blog** — each post is a React component with exported `meta` (title, date, tags, excerpt, cover).
-   Built with **React + Vite + styled-components**, deployed on **GitHub Pages**.
-   No CMS. Content lives in the repo → easy diffs, PR reviews, and instant deploys.
